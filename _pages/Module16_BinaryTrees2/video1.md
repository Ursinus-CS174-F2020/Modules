<h2>Notes</h2>


<ul>
<li>The <code>level</code> of a node in a binary tree is the minimum length path from the root to that node.</li>
<li>The <code>depth</code> of a tree is the maximum level over all nodes.</li>
<li>We often implement recursive functions on trees by having two overloaded versions of a method: one to kick off the recursion on the root node, and one to continue the recursion on internal nodes.</li>
</ul>
