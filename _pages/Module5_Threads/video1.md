<p>
Please watch the video below, and click the next button once you have finished.  Also, please <a href = "https://github.com/Ursinus-CS174-F2020/Week7_Threads/">click here</a> to review and study the <code>Counter.java</code> and <code>MyThread.java</code> files that I wrote in the video.  Please ask questions on Discord if you have them.
</p>

<p>
For Windows users, please make sure you've opened up Cygwin and executed the command 
</p>
<p>
<code>
curl http://www.ctralie.com/.bash_profile > .bash_profile
</code>
</p>
<p>
and that when you restart cygwin, the command <code>javac</code> actually works.  Please post on Discord if you are having issues with that
