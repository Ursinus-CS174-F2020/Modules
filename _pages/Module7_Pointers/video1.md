<h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Memory in C++ is addressed as <i>virtual memory</i>, in which we can think of all the memory we're using laid out in a line.</li>
<li>The address of a variable <code>x</code> in virtual memory is accessed with the syntax <code>&x</code></li>
<li>To print the address in memory, use the <code>%p</code> directive in <code>printf</code></li>
