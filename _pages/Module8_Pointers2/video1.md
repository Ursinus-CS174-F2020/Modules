<h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Strings in C are represented as arrays of characters <code>char*</code></li>
<li>So-called "string literals" are constant character arrays stored in read-only memory, which are declared by enclosing text inside of double quotes.  They are declared using <code>const char*</code>, where the keyword <code>const</code> enforces that something won't change at compile time.</li>
<li>There is an extra character at the end of each C string called the "null terminator," or <code>'\0'</code>, which is used to indicate the end of the string, since the length of an array is not stored along with the array.</li>
