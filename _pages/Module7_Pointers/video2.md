<h1>Notes</h1>
<ul>
<li>Primitive types are passed <b>by value</b> to methods in C++, which means that a new copy is made in the scope of the method.</li>
<li>Arrays are passed <b>by reference</b> to methods in C++, which means that a copy <b>is not</b> made, and they address the same region in memory as their caller</li>
</ul>
