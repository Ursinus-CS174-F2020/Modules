This last exercise is to make sure you're able to compile and run the audio code, which we will continue exploring in class on Friday.  Please follow the directions at <a href = "https://ursinus.instructure.com/courses/11017/assignments/102684">this link on Canvas</a>.  This will also serve as an opportunity for everyone to demonstrate that their C++ compiler is setup properly.
